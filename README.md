# Trilateration_GPS
[Work in Progress]
Programmed in Matlab, this code will use various methods to calculate the distance from a moving object to 8 beacons located at different points. Additionally, calculations are done to estimate the XYZ co-ordinates of the object at a given time using the nonlinear least square method.
